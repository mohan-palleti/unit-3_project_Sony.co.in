<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

Most of the HTML Page are static and most of the functionalities like Sign In/Sign UP and Checking for Local Sony Centres are dynamic . But in order to Use or Check functionalities Such as Opening the Product Section,Search and ADD/DELETE products(ADMIN ACCESS). You need to run JSON-Server on your Node JS Terminal. As we couldn't find a free API to get the Product data we had to make our own Data Base.

<!-- This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps. -->

### Prerequisites & Installation

Make sure you have Node JS on your machine .Use the following NPM Package to get started and access all the functionalities of the Project.

<!--
This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them. -->

- Install NPM packages

  ```sh
  npm init

  npm mock-api-app

  npm i json-server
  ```

- Run server.js file

  ```
  node server.js
  ```
